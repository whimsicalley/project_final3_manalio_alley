# Final Project #3

Advanced Web 2 - Due August 5th, 2016

[Original Repo](https://github.com/richardkalehoff/UF-starter-project)

## Resources

1. [Using CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)

    I used this site to remember the transition properties for my navigation links.

2. [MixItUp jQuery plugin](https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/)

    This plugin is used on my menu page. Definitely fun to play with, however it did give me considerable pain to work.
