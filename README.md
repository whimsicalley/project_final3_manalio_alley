Advanced Web 2 - Due August 5th, 2016

[Original Repo](https://github.com/richardkalehoff/UF-starter-project)

[Live Site](http://alleymanalio.com/project_final3_manalio_alley/)

## Resources

1. [Using CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)

    I used this site to remember the transition properties for my navigation links.

2. [MixItUp jQuery plugin](https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/)

    This plugin is used on my menu page. Definitely fun to play with, however it did give me considerable pain to work.

3. [Slick jQuery plugin](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

    I used Slick to develop the image slider on the index page. Fairly straightforward, so that was nice. :)

4. [Fake Address Generator](http://www.fakeaddressgenerator.com/World_Address/get_fr_address)

    Gotta love the Internet! Who knew this existed? I used this to create a fake Parisian address/phone number.

5. [Make a Clickable Phone Link](http://allwebco-templates.com/support/S_smartphone-link.htm)

    Helped me learn how to create a clickable telephone for mobile.

6. [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/)

    I used this to create icons. I loved using it in my resume project so I was happy to use them again.

7. [Text on Image Hover](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14263594/how-to-show-text-on-image-when-hovering)

    I've always like the look over text overlaying an image, but didn't know how to do it. I was happy to find it was a fairly simple process.

8. [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

    I used this site for a majority of my images.

## Comments

1. I know I had stayed after class to ask if I could use Backstretch, and you'll notice that I didn't use it. I wanted to, but I kind of like how clean it is with the tablecloth-like background underneath a white "menu" with all the content. I figured I would stick with the design I already had.

2. I noticed on my image slider on the index page, that when I had the border set to all 4 sides, the right border would disappear. Do you have any idea why this might be happening?

3. Custom code: I chose to add them both to the About page because it was the least interesting, in my opinion.

    * Custom jQuery: When you click on the image of Gusteau, an image of Remy appears below it's previous sibling, the h3 tag "History." A quote below it also appears, as though Remy is talking to the user. I liked this because in the desktop, they appear side by side. :)

    * Custom JavaScript: When you click on any of the list items, a new list item adds itself to the bottom of the list discussing holiday hours.

4. I wasn't sure how to correct the addEventListener error message I was getting in DevTools on the pages it didn't apply to.

5. Without question the most challenging project of the semester but, I guess that's why it's the final! Thanks for a great semester, Richard, I really learned a lot.
